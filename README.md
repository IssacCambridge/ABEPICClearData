This is a small project I created which allows you to clear your rovio account data, decode save file and encode all in one command.

# Features
It automatically writes the decode, encode and cleared base64 string to the com.rovio.gold.v2.playerprefs.xml file

# How to use

You must put your player data file (com.rovio.gold.v2.playerprefs.xml) in the same folder as the program for it to work.

# ! IMPORTANT
Make sure you have the following modules installed:
* xmltodict
